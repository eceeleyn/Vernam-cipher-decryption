# Vernam-cipher-decryption
I have written a decryption algorithm for Vernam encryption in the C programming language.  However, one of the disadvantages of this algorithm is that it does not automatically obtain the plaintext and key from the user in order to decrypt . Instead, the user needs to manually provide this information inside the code.  But you can ask the user for this information by asking questions.
